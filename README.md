# Limu Microbiome - Ocean Era Nov Sampling


## Craig's Initial Obvservations
- Limu distinct from water
- Deep water tap distinct from other stuff
- Experiment GE homogenous
- Experiment PF homogenous
- HB, EC_H and SD_H swamped with cyanobacteria (these are all Halymenia)
- Caulerpa may have a lot of Vibrio on it
- Gracialaria has some dominant unusual families

## TODO:
- Ordinations [DONE]
- Heatmaps [SEAN]
  - Family
  - Genus
  - ASV
- Investigate structured experiments [SEAN]
	- Caulerpa flow rate trial
	- Effluent concentration trial
- Investigate Vibrio [NIC]
	- Higher in Caulerpa?
- Investigate families associated with Gracillaria [NIC]
	- Are they unique?
